# BekarApp-AndroidViewBinding
An example of new JetPack ViewBinding in Android Studio

This is a too much simple of a project just to show the MINIMALISTIC usage of the new ViewBinding thing (so to speak) 
in the jetpack component.

ViewBinding was in buzz since Google IO 2019. Developers were using Data Binding to leverage the power of ViewBinding which is
introduced now.

By the way, you need Android Studio 3.6+ to try out View Binding 

## Basically ViewBinding can be called a subset of DataBinding
